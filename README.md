# TravelApp
Travel App is a mobile application that provides information about some places, so people can 
chose their trips. 
The app was built with Flutter, Dart, and Cubit, is compatible with Android and iOS.
It is important to know that not all screens were implemented, but a couple of them just to
build a study base about Flutter.

## Features

- Welcome page: shows some places and the reason why they're so requested.
- Home page: shows tabbar to different pages, a list view with all the places loaded.
- Detail page: shows the details from the selected place, like location, description, and stars.
- All the data is provided from an already existing API.

## Tech

TravelApp uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) - user interface development kit
- [Cubit](https://pub.dev/documentation/flutter_cubit/latest/) - Flutter library built to expose widgets that integrate with cubits
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) - client-optimized language for fast apps on any platform
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - great source code editor

## Installation

TravelApp requires:
- [FlutterSDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) v3.3.10+
- [AndroidSDK](https://developer.android.com/studio)

And then
```sh
flutter run
```
